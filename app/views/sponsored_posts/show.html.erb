             the default method (:sponsored_post) with :delete so that when the button is pressed the route called is the delete 
             route. We style the button by setting class: to 'btn btn-danger'. We pass a Hash with the confirm: key to 
             the data: argument. This confirms the action with a JavaScript confirmation dialog when a user presses the button. -->
